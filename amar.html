           <p>Vikram is a 2022 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film written and directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj and produced by Raaj Kamal Films International.[5] The film stars Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil.[6][7] Kalidas Jayaram,[8] Narain and Chemban Vinod Jose play supporting roles while Suriya makes a cameo appearance. It is the second installment in the Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU). The film's soundtrack and score are composed by Anirudh Ravichander, with cinematography handled by Girish Gangadharan and editing done by Philomin Raj. The film continues from Kaithi and follows a black-ops squad led by Amar tracking down masked vigilantes, while he learns of a drug syndicate group called Vetti Vagaiyara, led by Sandhanam, who wants the missing drugs to be delivered to his cold-blooded boss.

            Principal photography of the film began on 16 July 2021. Vikram was released theatrically on 3 June 2022.[9] The movie is a spiritual successor of the 1986 film with the same name[10], as cast the lead character is the same as the 1986 film. The movie also features a remixed version of the theme song from the former film and, as said is seen as a spiritual successor of it while being a direct sequel to the 2019 film Kaithi.[11][12] Vikram was released to positive reviews from critics.[13]
            Following the events after busting the illegal consignment of Adaikalam and Anbu by Inspector Bejoy,[N 1] Amar, the head of a black-ops team, is summoned by Police Chief Jose to bring justice to a group of masked vigilantes, who have killed Stephen Raj (following his arrest and subsequent release), ACP Prabhanjan and his adopted father, Karnan. Amar leads the investigation by digging into Karnan's life, whose murder seems out of place, as Karnan was a common man and the other two were higher officials in the Narcotics division. He learns about Karnan's past as a drunkard, drug addict, and womaniser, but is very close to his adopted infant grandson. While investigating, Amar learns about the missing containers needed by Sandhanam, who is part of a large family and runs a crime syndicate named Vetti Vagaiyara. Sandhanam wants the drugs to be delivered to his cold-blooded smuggler boss named Rolex, whose identity is unknown to anyone. If the drugs are delivered, Rolex will help Sandhanam form his own government.

            Meanwhile, Veerapandian, who is a gang member of Vetti Vagaiyara, assigns a meeting with other gangsters at a casino theatre, where he reveals that he, along with another gang member named Rudra Pratap, know the location of the drug containers as they want to bring the containers to Rolex, bypassing Sandhanam in the process. However, the masked men arrive and kill Veerapandian. After learning that Veerapandian is the target of the masked men from a chip found in Karnan's house, Amar chases after them and captures the main head, revealed to be Bejoy. Amar interrogates Bejoy, where Bejoy tells them that the syndicate members killed his family after busting the drug consignment. Realizing that Rudra Pratap is also the target of the members, Amar, along with his team, barges into Rudra Pratap's daughter's wedding ceremony, where Rudra Pratap has also invited Sandhanam.
            
            The masked men, along with their leader, arrive at Rudra Pratap's daughter's wedding, where the leader forces Rudra Pratap by holding his daughter at knifepoint, drags Rudra Pratap, and escapes from the wedding. He leaves some of his members to deal with Sandhanam, but Sandhanam thrashes all of them. Amar chases the masked men, where he confronts the leader, who makes a video call to Sandhanam and reveals himself as Karnan, who is actually alive and faked his death. Karnan kills Rudra Pratap and escapes from the police. Amar learns that Karnan is actually Arun Kumar Vikram aka Vikram, who is a former RAW officer where he, along with his team, were disbanded after a botched mission and declared as terrorists. However, Vikram's team members are now dead, except for Vikram. Amar meets up with Jose and reveals that Jose, himself, is Sandhanam's mole in the department.
            
            It is revealed that Sandhanam was the one who killed Prabhanjan, along with Jose's help, as he learned Sandhanam's involvement with Jose. Amar orchestrates a bomb blast at Sandhanam's house, which destroys his drug lab and other supplies. However, Sandhanam (who was informed by Jose) escapes, along with his family. Jose reveals Vikram's identity to Sandhanam. Later, Vikram arrives at the prison and frees Bejoy and his team. Sandhanam kills Amar's girlfriend, Gayathri, and attacks Vikram's daughter-in-law and grandson, but Vikram arrives and saves them, without their knowledge. Distraught at Gayathri's death, Amar joins Vikram's gang to bust Sandhanam and his crimes. He leaves for Jose's house and kills him after learning about his involvement in Gayathri's murder. It is revealed that the reason for Vikram's vengeance is a mission to bust the drug syndicate and that Prabhanjan was Vikram's real son. Afterwards, Vikram reaches the Chennai port, where the containers are hidden. However, Sandhanam learns about the container's hideout and attacks Vikram. Vikram shoots Sandhanam's men with a Cannon and DShK and kills Sandhanam, with the help of his team. Amar mourns Gayathri's death with the syndicate destroyed and dons the mask to continue Vikram's mission, by joining his team, along with Bejoy.
            
            In the mid-credits scene, in Sassoon Docks, Mumbai, Anbu (who is actually alive) and Adaikalam, along with the gangsters affiliated with Sandhanam, hold a meeting with their boss, Rolex. Adaikalam and Anbu reveal Dilli's involvement in their drug ambush, and Sandhanam's men reveal Vikram and Amar's involvement in destroying their drug syndicate. Rolex announces a huge sum as a reward for the execution of Dilli and Vikram's team. However, unknown to Rolex and everybody else at the meeting, Vikram is hiding amongst the gangsters, and learns about the bounty placed on his team and Dilli. The film ends with the announcement of the sequel: Vikram 2.</p>
