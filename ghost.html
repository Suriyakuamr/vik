            Apart from Kamal Haasan two other popular actors, Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil, are playing lead roles in the movie. The Hindi trailer of the upcoming action dram was also released on May 19. Now, the enthusiasm among the fans has increased after another star’s name from the cast of the film has been revealed. Vikram director Lokesh Kanagaraj recently revealed that actor Suriya is playing a cameo in the movie.

            However, when the trailer released, Suriya’s role was not revealed, although some fans took screenshots of a particular scene in the trailer and claimed that Suriya is playing a role in the film. Suriya’s face was visible in the screengrab, so there was a doubt about the claims made by fans.
            
            Suriya’s cameo was first reported in May when a video of Suriya and Kamal meeting on the set of a movie went gone viral on social media. The team of Vikram did not confirm it until the release of the trailer last week. Now, Kamal Haasan has opened up about Suriya’s role in Vikram.
            Speaking to Film Companion at the Cannes Film Festival, Kamal Haasan when asked about Suriya’s cameo in the movie, said, “It’s no more a rumour. We had to put up our hand and admit that Suriya is playing an incredible last-minute appearance. That should take the story a little further, probably into part 3.” This statement implies that the makers are not only gearing up for a sequel but a trilogy or maybe even a franchise. However, Kamal did not divulge too many details about it.

             Suriya was the special guest for the premiere of the film’s soundtrack and trailer. Suriya had accepted the offer despite being asked to join the film at the last minute, according to Kamal Haasan. Vikram stars Kalidas Jayaram, Antony Varghese and Arjun Das, among others, in important roles. The film is expected to be a high-octane action thriller. The film will be released in theatres on June 3.
            One of the biggest superstars of Tamil cinema, Suriya is said to have shot for a cameo appearance in the movie. A video of Suriya and Kamal Haasan on the same sets and hugging each other has been going viral on social media for the last hours. According to the inside sources, the makers have shot scenes with features Suriya just days ago. Since the news of Suriya being a part of the movie was confirmed, the social media has been roaring to know more about the character of the actor and also they are eager to know whether the actor will be sharing screen space with Kamal Haasan in a single frame or that whether all the dynamic actor Superstars, Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi, Fahad Faasil and Suriya would be coming face to face with each other in the movie. Here are all the details of the movie so far:

               One of the main rumours that have been speculating around the media is that the actor is in the film as the younger self of Kamal Haasan, which has really gotten the fans excited to the core. The makers of the movie have already confirmed that there are portions in the movie that involves the need for a younger version of the character played by Kamal Haasan and the makers also revealed that they wouldn’t be opting for any other actor other than Kamal Haasan himself to play the younger version of himself. For that, the makers have used the advanced de ageing technology for the first time in the Indian cinema industry to make Kamal Haasan younger on screen. Now from the rumours in the air, it seems that Lokesh and Kamal Haasan aren’t pleased with the work that the de ageing technology has done and have opted to shoot those portions with Suriya. Thus if the rumours are true Suriya could very well be playing the younger version of Kamal Haasan in the movie.
               One other rumour that has gotten the fans excited is the news that Suriya will be playing a character related to the character of Anbu and Adaikalam played by Arjun Das and Harish Uthaman in Kaithi, a 2019 movie directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj himself and starring Karthi in the lead role. the reason for this rumour to start was that the cameo appearance shoot was done by Suriya along with Arjun Das and Harish Uthaman. If the rumour is true and with Kaithi 2 on the card, the fans might be able to see the brothers in a single movie after all, with Kaithi 2 being Karthi vs Suriya.
               The movie is being produced by kamal hassan released on 3rd june 2022.</p>
