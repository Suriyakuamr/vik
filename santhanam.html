            The film's principal photography began with a photoshoot session on 16 July 2021.[75] The team began shooting for the film's first schedule in Karaikudi on 6 August, which was delayed eventually since the shooting of Suriya's Etharkkum Thunindhavan, took place in the same location and the crew had to begin filming only after the crew members leave the location post-shooting, as per the COVID-19 safety regulations.[76] The first schedule began on 20 August, and shooting took place for a month in Karaikudi. The team began second schedule of the film in Chennai on 19 September and later moved to Pondicherry, to shoot further sequences.[77] The second schedule of the film was subsequently wrapped on 2 October 2021.[78][79] On 13 October, the film makers started shooting for the third schedule of the film.[80] The team planned to shoot two sequences at the Tamil Nadu Police Museum for four days, including two days of set work in 24–25 October and two days of shooting 27–28 October 2021, but the officials denied permission to shoot there, citing pandemic restrictions. The makers later decided to postpone the shoot, as they needed an alternative location.[81][82]

The team began the final and month-long schedule on 17 November 2021 in Coimbatore,[83][84] with scenes featuring Haasan, Sethupathi and Faasil being shot.[85][86] However, filming was halted after Kamal Haasan was diagnosed with COVID-19 after his travel to the United States, for the inauguration of his clothing brand.[87] This resulted in the team shooting major stunt sequences indoors.[88] A set work with more than 50 damaged cars, had been shot in Coimbatore during this schedule, and following the actor's health condition, the team decided to shift the location to Binny Mills for continuity.[88] Shooting resumed on 10 December 2021 with important sequences being canned with other actors and later Haasan joined the sets on 22 December.[89]

In late-December 2021, the team continued shooting few sequences at a house located in East Coast Road at a quick pace. However, in early-January, the shoot had to be stalled after a few technicians working on the film were infected with COVID-19. The production cost simultaneously increased as the rent paid for the house was enormous, even on non-shooting days.[90] Furthermore, Haasan's medical commitments and his participation in the Bigg Boss Ultimate show, delayed the shooting further, which resulted in the team skipping an entire schedule.[91] Due to the rise in COVID-19 infections in Tamil Nadu, the team planned to shoot the film with minimal crew.[91] On 24 January 2022, the team shot few sequences at the premises of Vettri Theatres in Chromepet (Chennai).[92][93] The final filming schedule began on 5 February 2022, with face off scenes with Haasan and Sethupathi being shot for 15 days.[94][95]

To prioritise for the film's shooting, Haasan stepped down as the host for Bigg Boss Ultimate show, and participated for patchwork filming.[96] On 1 March, it was announced that filming had completely wrapped.[97]
